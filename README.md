# web_crawler2_with_Python
Here's a much much better crawler than the last one I wrote. The last one was not much flexible and was written in C#, this time though I wrote this crawler using python, urllib and beautiful soup packages. paljon onnea


To use this crawler:
- have python3 installed
- run the "crawler.py" file in (command prompt / prefered shell)
- the "bs4" folder contains beautiful soup library, do not alter them
- the "crawler_docs.txt" file contains some comments and extra output to tell you what is going on at the time. to use it, simply change the format to .py
