# web_crawler2_with_Python
Here's a much much better crawler than the last one I wrote. The last one was not much flexible and was written in C#, this time though I wrote this crawler using python, urllib and beautiful soup packages. paljon onnea


To use this crawler:
- have python3 installed
- run crawler.py
- don't mess around with /bs4
- crawler_docs.txt contains some comments and extra output to tell you what is going on at the time. to use it, simply change it's extention to .py
