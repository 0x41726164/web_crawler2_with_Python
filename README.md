# web_crawler2_with_Python
This repository contains the python version of a crawler which is more superior and flexible than the last one I wrote in C#. It is easy to turn it into a web scrapper as well (as I have done many times for a variety of autonomous tasks).

- This script utilizes the beautifulsoup4 package. If it is present in 'pip list', you shouldn't need the 'bs4' directory that is present in this repository.
- 'crawler_docs.txt' is the same script with extended comments and information. To use it, simply rename the extension to .py and run it. This file acts as a --verbose switch.
